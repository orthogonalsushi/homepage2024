                            Himachal Pradesh, state of India, in the extreme northern part of the Asian subcontinent.
                            It is bounded by Jammu and Kashmir union territory to the northwest and Ladakh union territory to the northeast,
                            by the Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the east, and by the states of Uttarakhand to the southeast, Haryana to the south,
                            and Punjab to the west. Himachal Pradesh occupies a region of scenic splendour in the western Himalayas, offering a multitextured display of lofty snow-clad mountains,
                            deep gorges, thickly forested valleys, large lakes, terraced fields, and cascading streams.
                            Indeed, the name of the state is a reference to its setting: Himachal means “snowy slopes” (Sanskrit: hima, “snow”; acal, “slopes”), and Pradesh means “state.”

            <h3>Land</h3>
            <p>
                Within the diverse terrain of Himachal Pradesh are several parallel physiographic regions corresponding to the northwest-southeast-trending ranges of the Himalayan mountain system.
                The region adjacent to the plains of Punjab and Haryana consists of two stretches of the Siwalik (Shiwalik) Range (the Outer Himalayas) separated by long, narrow valleys.
                Elevations in the southern tract of the region average about 1,600 feet (500 metres), while in the northern tract they range between 3,000 and 5,000 feet (900 and 1,500 metres).
                To the north of the Siwaliks are the Lesser (or Lower) Himalayas, which rise to about 15,000 feet (4,500 metres). Within this region are the spectacular snow-capped Dhaola Dhar and Pir Panjal ranges.
                To the north again is the Zaskar Range, which reaches elevations of more than 22,000 feet (6,700 metres), towering over the other ranges in the region. Many active mountain glaciers originate in this area.
            </p>
            <p>
                Himachal Pradesh has many perennial snow-fed rivers and streams, in addition to four major watercourses.
                The eastern portion of the state is drained primarily by the Sutlej River, which rises in Tibet.
                Draining the western part of Himachal Pradesh are the Chenab (Chandra-Bhaga), Ravi, and Beas rivers, which have their source in the Great Himalayas.

                            Terrace farming in Himachal Pradesh involves creating flat areas on mountain slopes to reduce soil erosion and water runoff.
                            This method is essential in the hilly terrain of Mandi, allowing farmers to grow crops like wheat and rice effectively while preventing soil loss and managing water efficiently.

            <h3>Climate</h3>
            <p>
                The Siwalik region has hot summers (March to June), with temperatures rising above 100 °F (38 °C), cool and dry winters (October to February), and a wet season (July to September), with rains brought by the southwestern monsoon.
                As elevations increase farther north, the climate becomes wetter and cooler. In the Great Himalayas, winters are bitterly cold and snowy, with temperatures dropping below 0 °F (–18 °C).

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                The history of this mountainous state is complex and fragmented.
                It is known that a number of so-called Aryan groups filtered into the more productive valleys during the Vedic period (c. 1500 to 500 bce) and assimilated the pre-Aryan population.
                Later, successive Indian empires—such as the Mauryan (c. 321–185 bce), the Gupta (c. 320–540 ce), and the Mughal (1526–1761), all emerging in the Indo-Gangetic Plain—sought to
                exercise varying degrees of control over trade and pilgrimage routes into the area and between India and Tibet across the Himalayas.
            </p>
            <p>
                The remote, predominantly Buddhist area that is now the district of Lahaul and Spiti was controlled by Ladakh from the decline of the Mughal Empire (about the mid-18th century)
                until the early 1840s, when it briefly came under Sikh rule. Also during this period, warring semiautonomous petty rulers controlled the trade routes, as well as desirable
                segments of agricultural and pastoral land, in the other areas of present-day Himachal Pradesh. British domination of this region followed the Sikh Wars of the 1840s and continued,
                directly or indirectly, for the next 100 years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Around the time of Indian independence in 1947, there was a popular movement to end feudalism in the region, and the princely state of Suket virtually surrendered to peaceful demonstrators.
                Subsequently, Himachal Pradesh was constituted as a province in 1948. It consisted of 30 princely states and was administered by a chief commissioner, who represented the government of India.
            </p>
            <p>
                Between 1948 and its achievement of statehood in 1971, Himachal Pradesh went through various changes in size and administrative form. It became a substate under the Indian constitution of 1950.
                In 1954 it joined with Bilaspur (a former Indian state and then a chief commissioner’s province), and in 1956 it became a union territory. Himachal Pradesh was enlarged in 1966 by the merger and
                absorption of numerous Punjab hill areas, including the regions surrounding Shimla, Kangra, and Kullu; the district of Lahaul and Spiti; and parts of the districts centred at Ambala, Hoshiarpur, and Gurdaspur.
                Early in 1971, Himachal Pradesh became the 18th state of India; Y.S. Parmar, who since the 1940s had been a leader in the quest for self-government in Himachal Pradesh, became the state’s first chief minister.
