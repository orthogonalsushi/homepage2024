                        Both flash floods and landslides are impossible to foresee in advance.
                        There is always a loud and peculiar sound that accompanies flash floods and landslides when they occur.
                        If very large rocks collide with one another and trees break, the result is a sound that is exceptionally thunderous and may be heard from quite a distance.
                        An overflow of water that typically submerges the dry land is what we refer to as a flood.
                        The most common type of natural disaster is the one that accounts for most fatalities across the world.
                        A flash flood not only has an impact and widespread impact on the people, but it also has an impact and widespread consequences on the environment and the economy.

            <h3>Improve Current Flood Detection and Warning Systems</h3>
            <p>
                During times of flash flooding, it would be beneficial to have a better flood warning system that would give people additional time to prepare and act.
                It also has the potential to save further lives by issuing a timely warning.

            <h3>Build your structures higher than the floodplains</h3>
            <p>
                To protect against the risk of flooding, you should construct a building that is at least one meter above the ground.
                It is necessary to reinforce traditional defenses with more cutting-edge strategies to reduce the likelihood of further catastrophes.

            <h3>Restore Rivers to their Natural Courses</h3>
            <p>
                Many river courses have undergone historical rerouting to make them more navigable.
                Remaining rivers that have had their natural curves straightened out can have their length increased by reintroducing the curves,
                which in turn can delay the flow of floodwaters and lessen the impact of floods farther downstream.

            <h3>Rehabilitate Rivers and Ensure Drainage is Clear</h3>
            <p>
                Restoring rivers and maintaining clean drainage can help prevent flooding.
                The fundamental reality is that the rivers will be restored to their natural state and that the drainages will be clean.
                It is possible to exercise control over the flow of water, so mitigating the risk of potential harm.
